# Orbit Engine - Solar System Simulator

A real-time solar system simulator with interplanetary trajectory planning capabilities.

## Features

- **3D Solar System Visualization**: Real-time rendering of planets orbiting the Sun using Three.js
- **Time Controls**: Play, pause, and adjust simulation speed (1x to 1,000,000x)
- **Trajectory Planning**: Calculate optimal transfer orbits between planets
- **Porkchop Plots**: Visualize launch windows and energy requirements
- **Mission Simulation**: Launch and track spacecraft along calculated trajectories
- **Interactive Controls**: Click on planets to view detailed information

## Architecture

### Backend (Python FastAPI)
- **Orbital Mechanics Engine**: Calculates planetary positions using Kepler's equations
- **Trajectory Calculator**: Computes Hohmann transfer orbits and porkchop plots
- **WebSocket Server**: Streams real-time simulation updates to frontend
- **REST API**: Handles trajectory calculations and mission launches

### Frontend (React + Three.js)
- **3D Visualization**: Solar system rendered with Three.js/React Three Fiber
- **Physics Panel**: Select different physics engines (currently Orbital Mechanics)
- **Control Panels**: Time controls, body information, mission status
- **Trajectory Planner**: Interactive interface for mission planning
- **WebSocket Client**: Receives real-time simulation updates

### Trajectory Visualization
- Green line: Planned trajectory path
- Green cone: Spacecraft position
- Progress bar: Mission completion status

## Concept Design

The application is built using concept design principles with the following core concepts:

- **CelestialBody**: Manages planetary states and positions
- **Simulation**: Controls time flow and simulation state
- **Trajectory**: Calculates interplanetary transfers
- **Mission**: Manages spacecraft missions
- **Camera**: Controls 3D view perspective
