## Implementing Concepts

- Use TypeScript
- Each concept is a single class with the name `${name}Concept`, and should be
  contained in a single .ts file under the directory `./concepts`
- All actions must take exactly one argument, and return one argument
- The shape of the input and output arguments are described in the corresponding
  concept specification in the form of `key: type`
- The names of actions must match up exactly with those in the specification
- For the purposes of the `where` clause in the synchronizations, and for
  generally querying state, each concept may also have query functions
- Query functions MUST start with the underscore character `_` to distinguish
  them from actions
- Query functions MUST NOT update state or perform side-effects
- Query functions will also take as input a single argument with named keys, but
  instead **return an array** of such arguments corresponding to the names of
  the desired state. This is because query functions enable synchronizations in
  the `where` clause to e.g. declaratively find all comments related to a post,
  where each comment becomes a new frame for the purposes of the `then` clause,
  such as deleting all comments of a post when the post is deleted.
- In general, if a concept is well behaving, you should not need to update it
  except to add query functions for the purposes of accessing state

Creating a concept instance should initialize the concept with whatever
underlying services it needs to store and manage data. For this application, use
MongoDB and refer to `concept-state-specification.mdc` for details on how to
translate SSF to MongoDB. Use the TypeScript MongoDB driver, and use best
practices and have all configuration shared as environment variables. You may
share a single database between all concepts, but should separate collections
for concepts. We are using the Deno runtime for simplified imports, where you
should prefer the generic name without the version number for more robust
imports that have less of a chance to break.
